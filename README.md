Test: Movies.

This project is a part of the technical tests to be a web developer.
In this case it is a list of 8 movies in which you can filter by genre and it will show you the results
by extracting the information from an API.

It is made with React and if you want to see it on your computer you must download the repository,
install the dependencies with the command console with `npm install` and then use the `npm run dev` command to assign a local server.
